# 📊 Lance vs Delta vs Iceberg, 🔗 Lance Blob V2 Late Materialization, 🤖 Stable-Worldmodel Research Platform

## ‍📊 A Metadata Benchmark of Lance, Delta Lake, and Iceberg on S3


In a 10,000-commit benchmark on S3, Lance averaged 140ms commit latency versus 534ms for Delta Lake and 457ms for Iceberg. Active metadata footprint stayed at 0.78 MiB compared to 42+ MiB for Iceberg.


At 200 concurrent writers, Lance saw a 16% failure rate versus 88% for Delta Lake and 89–94% for Iceberg. The gap comes from publishing compact manifests directly to storage instead of relying on log replay or a catalog service.

## 🔗 Lance Blob V2: Late Materialization for Large Binary Data in Spark


Updating a label on a row with a 50MB video shouldn’t require Spark to read that video — Lance Blob V2 keeps blob columns as lightweight descriptors through the query plan, materializing bytes only at write time.


` UPDATE` ,` MERGE` ,` INSERT…SELECT` , and joins all carry copy tokens that resolve during the write path, so mixed tables with small thumbnails and large clips can use different layouts row by row without schema changes. The SQL stays the same — what changes is that Spark moves references instead of payloads.

## 🤖 Stable-Worldmodel: A High Performance Platform for Reproducible World Model Research


stable-worldmodel’s Lance data layer delivers ~4,800 samples/sec on Push-T versus ~1,400 for HDF5 locally, and ~3,200 samples/sec reading directly from S3 — training from object storage without syncing to local disk first.


The loader is URI-agnostic —` s3://` ,` gs://` , HF Buckets, or local paths all run the same code — and Lance’s zero-copy data evolution adds vector, FTS, or hybrid indexes to training data at no performance cost. LeWorldModel trains end-to-end from pixels on a single H200 in hours, hitting 94% success on Push-T with 50× less planning latency than DINO-WM.

## 🎤 Talks & Recordings


**Less Tokio is More Tokio: Strategies for Accelerating a Rust Native Search Database by Weston Pace, Lu Qiu**


*Weston Pace (LanceDB) · Lu Qiu (LanceDB)*


Weston Pace and Lu Qiu present how LanceDB achieved storage roofline performance by redesigning their Rust I/O loop to use fewer Tokio tasks, eagerly poll futures during I/O submission, and adopt a push/pull scheduling API—along with profiling techniques for complex async applications.

**Agents Will Break Your Stack**


*Chang She (LanceDB) · Ben Lorica (Gradient Flow)*


Chang She, co-founder and CEO of LanceDB, discusses with Ben Lorica why traditional analytical tools like Pandas and Parquet fall short for AI workloads, the concept of a “multimodal lakehouse,” and the unique data storage and retrieval challenges that AI agents introduce.

**Trillion is the New Billion: Managing Really Large Multimodal Datasets for AI**


*Lei Xu (LanceDB)*


This talk covers the data infrastructure challenges of managing trillion-row multimodal datasets for AI workloads, explaining why existing systems fall short for storing large blobs, supporting search/curation/training directly from datasets, and handling distributed pipelines across clouds—with a look under the hood at how Lance format and LanceDB address these problems and fit alongside Iceberg.

## 📸 AI Engineer World's Fair in SF


We had a great time at AI Engineer World's Fair in San Francisco last week! Thanks to everyone who stopped by the booth to say hi and dive into LanceDB internals.


It was great meeting everyone who came out to our events last week: SPIN SF with Theory Ventures & Ollama and USA World Cup Watch Party with Exa, Extend, and Fastino Labs. Both were packed, both were a good time, and we'd absolutely do them again.


## 📅 Upcoming Events


**AI Lakehouse Meetup** — July 15, 2026 · 5-8pm PT · San Jose, CA


*ChanChan Mao (LanceDB) · Lu Qiu (LanceDB)*


Covers building multimodal lakehouse with Lance and LanceDB—unified vector, full-text, and SQL search across text, images, and embeddings without forcing separate systems for each modality. Hosted at Cloudera’s San Jose office with talks by ChanChan Mao and Lu Qiu from LanceDB.

**Ceph: Object Storage Meets Vector Search** — July 16, 2026 · 10am PT / 1pm ET · Virtual


*Prashanth Rao (LanceDB) · Kyle Bader (IBM) · Christine Bassani (Seagate)*


Ceph is integrating LanceDB libraries to deliver vector search through S3 Vectors API actions, enabling billion-scale, multi-tenant nearest neighbor search directly within existing object storage infrastructure. The implementation targets RAG workloads without requiring a separate vector database deployment.

## 🏗️ LanceDB Enterprise Updates


### Performance


- **Faster query routing** — Caching per-query routing tables instead of rebuilding them on every request removed a CPU bottleneck that had cut throughput by roughly 13x under random-take (point-lookup) workloads.
- **Smarter cluster load placement** — A new two-choice consistent-hashing algorithm spreads index segments and query routing more evenly across nodes, with the underlying hash function now pinned so placement doesn't reshuffle if the Rust standard library's hash implementation changes.
- **Faster scalar index scans** — On billion-row indexes, scalar index results now serialize directly from the selected-row bitmap instead of rebuilding a merged copy, cutting CPU usage on this path by roughly 10% in steady state. **‍**
- **Lower-overhead index operations at scale** — Index status checks now read directly from stored manifests instead of disk, and index cache prewarming for multi-segment indexes drops from O(n2) to O(n) in segment count, reducing overhead as clusters grow.
- ‍ **Faster reads on recently written data** — Row-limited queries used to scan every generation of the not-yet-compacted layer in full before applying the limit; bounding the scan to the requested range instead cut a test query against an 18-generation backlog to roughly 27 requests and under 3 MB. **‍**
- **Reliability** — Index cache prewarming now covers every replica group, preventing cold-cache latency spikes on groups that weren’t previously warmed.


### Features


Feature Description


Branching for tables Tables now support git-like branches — create, delete, checkout — with indexing, caching, and writes isolated per branch, so teams can experiment without touching production data.


Expanded distributed indexing The distributed indexing system now builds bitmap, label-list, and FM-index types, and distributes full-text and scalar indexing (including nested vector fields) across workers to keep pace with larger, more varied datasets.


Faster access to newly written data The low-latency layer serving data before compaction now supports full-text search, row-level deletes, and partial-column updates — freshly written data is searchable and editable without waiting on compaction.


New job management system A new job coordination system tracks background job runs end-to-end — discovery, event logging, and run-status APIs — improving visibility and reliability for long-running work.


Cache placement controls New admin APIs and CLI commands control where index and table caches are placed and prewarmed across a cluster, reducing cold-cache query latency at scale.

## 🤝 Lance Community Sync Recap


This month’s community syncs covered governance and format evolution for the Lance ecosystem. Format governance changes were discussed, including a requirement for votes before merging format changes and improved design review processes. A new shuffle format proposal was presented aimed at reducing IOPS and better supporting GPU workloads, alongside discussions of new indexes and core Lance architecture.


The next Lance Community Sync will take place on **Thursday, July 16 @ 9am PT** .
