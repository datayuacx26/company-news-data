# Honeydew and Snowflake Semantic Views

Last week, Snowflake announced the availability of[Semantic Views](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-semantic/overview) .


Let’s talk about how Semantic Views and Honeydew integrate: commonalities, differences, and how to *data mesh* Honeydew with your Semantic Views.


Lets start with,


## What is a Snowflake Semantic View?


A Semantic View is a schema-level object that:


1. Stores a single *Cortex semantic model*
2. And makes it available for AI or BI tools to consume with a special query interface.


For example, the semantic model below represents retail sales data:


- There are three connected tables (` line_items` ,` orders` and` customers` ) representing customers and their orders.
- There are metrics on top of them (such as` order_average_value` ) to allow counting customers, orders and their properties.


```text
CREATE   SEMANTIC VIEW tpch_analysis


TABLES (
orders   AS   SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA  .  TPCH_SF1  .ORDERS
PRIMARY KEY   (o_orderkey)
WITH   SYNONYMS (  'sales orders'  )
COMMENT   =   'All orders table for the sales domain'  ,
customers   AS   SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA  .  TPCH_SF1  .CUSTOMER
PRIMARY KEY   (c_custkey)
COMMENT   =   'Main table for customer data'  ,
line_items   AS   SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA  .  TPCH_SF1  .LINEITEM
PRIMARY KEY   (l_orderkey, l_linenumber)
COMMENT   =   'Line items in orders'
)


RELATIONSHIPS (
orders (o_custkey)   REFERENCES   customers,
line_items (l_orderkey)   REFERENCES   orders
)


FACTS (
line_items  .  line_item_id   AS   CONCAT  (l_orderkey,   '-'  , l_linenumber),
orders  .  count_line_items   AS   COUNT  (  line_items  .  line_item_id  ),
line_items  .  discounted_price   AS   l_extendedprice   *   (  1   -   l_discount)
COMMENT   =   'Extended price after discount'
)


DIMENSIONS (
customers  .  customer_name   AS   customers  .  c_name
customers  .  customer_market_segment   AS   customers  .  c_mkt_segment
orders  .  order_date   AS   o_orderdate
COMMENT   =   'Date when the order was placed'  ,
orders  .  order_year   AS   YEAR  (o_orderdate)
COMMENT   =   'Year when the order was placed'
)


METRICS (
customers  .  customer_count   AS   COUNT  (c_custkey)
COMMENT   =   'Count of number of customers'  ,
orders  .  order_average_value   AS   AVG  (  orders  .  o_totalprice  )
COMMENT   =   'Average order value across all orders'  ,
orders  .  average_line_items_per_order   AS   AVG  (  orders  .  count_line_items  )
COMMENT   =   'Average number of line items per order'
)
;
```


In addition to storing the **metadata** (a *semantic model* ), the Semantic View provides a way to consume that logic with a special[query language](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-semantic/querying) :


```text
-- Get the average order value by market segment
SELECT   *   FROM   SEMANTIC_VIEW(
tpch_analysis
DIMENSIONS   customer  .  customer_market_segment
METRICS   orders  .  order_average_value
);
```


When executing the query above, Snowflake will first join the customer and orders table, and then aggregate the` order_average_value` metric, grouped by` customer_market_segment` .


## Semantic View(s) and Honeydew


Honeydew is a Semantic Layer for AI+BI.


From a high level perspective, both Honeydew Semantic Layer and a Snowflake Semantic View appear to serve a similar task:


1. Create a single place for business logic on top of data in Snowflake
2. That consistently serves all AI and BI workloads


The core difference is **scope** : while a Semantic View is a singular schema-level object for a specific purpose, Honeydew is organization-wide layer for multiple data models and semantic views, serving diverse workloads and many semantic views.


But first, what happens if you wrap **one semantic view** in Honeydew?


## Step 1: One Semantic View in Honeydew


What a Semantic View is added as a source to Honeydew, Honeydew will extend the shared semantic layer with the Cortex Semantic Model stored in that view, and provide **all Honeydew functionality** on top of that view.


For example, if a Semantic View has defined a relationship between customers and orders, Honeydew will know those tables connect; if a Semantic View defines a summation metric, Honeydew will know that as well.


This has a number of use cases:


### Standard BI interface for a Semantic View


Honeydew supports a standard SQL interface and a metadata integration for many common BI tools such as Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Domo, Quicksight and others.


A Semantic View wrapped in Honeydew is immediately available to any BI tool for dynamic live queries. Honeydew also provides the BI tool with all the business-facing metadata (such as descriptions, folders or formatting) of the metrics and dimensions.


With dynamic live queries using standard SQL, there are no limits on what a user can do. They can ask on any level of detail of any metric with any filtering:


Whether the BI user is aggregating across all data or is looking at the details of a specific transaction, Honeydew *will create on the fly* a tailored and specific Snowflake query that answers the user question.


### Semantic Enrichment


Semantic Views are a relatively simple model with limited query functionality.


By using them as a source in Honeydew, that functionality can be extended:


1. To support more complex metrics (varying level of details, order of filtering, dynamic grouping, multi-fact relationships, time intelligence, etc.)
2. To support more flexibility with queries using the existing metrics defined in the view (for example allowing to mix levels of granularity in a query)
3. To support richer metadata (AI or BI-specific, such as a formatting)


**Note** : To support more enrichment, Honeydew query generation on a Semantic View model may seamlessly use Honeydew’s own semantic compiler as-required.


### Performance Optimization


Honeydew includes a set of performance features that include optimized query generation and caching. A common use case is *Aggregate Awareness* : using aggregated data in lieu of the original granular data when it matches a user query.


For example, if a user queries for total order value by customer segment, a simple query would join the a large` orders` table with` customers` and aggregate. If there are 100M orders, the query would process 100M rows.


However, with Aggregate Awareness, Honeydew can detect that there is a table with total order value already pre-computed by *customer id* . Honeydew compiler will then join to it` customers` to get the customer segment, and sum up the total order value. If there are 100,000 customers for those orders - then only 100,000 rows would need to be processed for the same response, 1000x faster.


### Explainability


The Honeydew Semantic Layer is built for collaboration and testing. As such, a number of Honeydew features can be helpful to understand a Semantic View: logic lineage, a relationship diagram, and a testing playground.


Queries generated by Honeydew are also explainable, transparently showing the particular joins or order of computation invoked. As the complexity of semantics grows, explainability becomes a key feature for maintaining correctness.


## Step 2: Many Semantic Views in Honeydew


As a singular object, Semantic Views can help to set the ownership boundaries for a single data product.


Honeydew connects data products together as sources with relationships, ownership, governance, versioning and testing, making Snowflake into a connected data mesh.


### Semantic View as a Data Contract


Data owners can use Semantic Views to create a data contract for their delivery. Honeydew enforces those contracts, as data sources connect across teams and domains.


### Collaborative Workflow for Semantics


As the number of users that use shared semantic logic scales up, so are the **collaboration requirements** .


Consider a single DDL statement (like a Semantic View) as a single “ *thing* ”.


In a collaborative environment like a semantic layer there are many “ *things* ” to agree on. Some are data sources (a table, a view or a semantic view acting as a data contract). Some are metric calculations, entity definitions, or business metadata. “Things have inter-dependencies, are shared across different domains, and have ownerships and metadata.


Things managed in Honeydew (called semantic objects) have a lifecycle and an associated workflow:


### Semantic Object


A semantic object in Honeydew can be a data source, an entity, a relationship, a metric, a domain, or an aggregated dataset. Every object has an owner, and is backed by a Git file (using your Git provider - GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Azure DevOps).


As a managed object, it is part of a change management workflow:


- **Ownership** : objects can have owner
- **Versioning** : objects always have a version (backed by Git)
- **Reviews and Approvals:** when an object changes, it can go through an approval and review process before being added to the shared semantic layer


It is also a part of a shared world, with:


- **Logic Lineage** : objects can be based on other objects. For example, a profit margin metric might be based on a profit metric and a cost metric (each managed by different teams). Note that in a semantic layer lineage is for *logic* , not for *data* , which makes traditional data lineage tools inapplicable.
- **Logic Reuse** : objects can (and should!) be reused, following the DRY (”Do not repeat yourself”) principle. For example, a customer entity or a revenue metric may participate in multiple other objects, such as aggregated datasets or domains with the same definition.
- **Impact Radius** : When an object changes or breaks, it’s important to know what is logically affected to avoid downstream failures, and create a foundation that minimizes the blast radius of a change.
- **Business Interpretation** : an ability to control (with versioning and collaboration) how an object appears to different business users, AI agents or BI tools. For example, a sales team and a marketing team might have different preferred names for the same metric.


### Development Workflow


As people collaborate on shared objects, Honeydew enables a development process with:


- **Development environments** : an ability to build and test changes in isolated environments for local development, testing and production.
- **Development** **workflow automation** : an ability to add automated testing or AI evaluations for changes that go into the shared semantic layer.
- **Granular Object Security** : different objects (like metrics) might have different access control, based on user roles. While security and governance in Snowflake apply to data, Security within a semantic layer applies to the semantic objects - the metadata.


As both data sources and targets diversify, Honeydew provides metadata synchronization for the shared semantic objects from source (i.e. a dbt model or a semantic view) to target (i.e., a Tableau workbook).


## Available Now!


Honeydew support for Semantic Views as a semantic source is currently in private preview.
