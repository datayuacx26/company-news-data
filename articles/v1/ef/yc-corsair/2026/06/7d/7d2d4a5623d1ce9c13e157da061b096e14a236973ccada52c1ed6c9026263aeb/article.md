# Anthropic Introduces Claude Fable 5, Its Most Capable Public AI Model Yet

On June 9, 2026, Anthropic announced Claude Fable 5, its most capable public AI model to date. The company describes it as a Mythos-class model made safe for general use and says it outperforms any AI model it has previously released publicly.


Claude Fable 5 announcement


Alongside Fable 5, Anthropic also introduced Claude Mythos 5, a version available only to a limited group of trusted users.


Claude Fable 5 is designed for software engineering, scientific research, knowledge work, and vision tasks. While it offers more advanced capabilities, Anthropic has also introduced safeguards that restrict responses in certain sensitive areas such as cybersecurity, biology, and chemistry.


In this article, let us explore what Claude Fable 5 is, its key features and capabilities, how it differs from Claude Mythos 5, the safety measures introduced by Anthropic, and what this launch means for developers and AI applications.


## What Is Claude Fable 5?


[Claude Fable 5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-fable-5-mythos-5) is Anthropic's most powerful publicly available AI model. It sits at the top of the company's model lineup and represents a major step forward from its previous public releases. The company describes it as a Mythos-class model, a tier of AI capability that sits above the Opus class and is built for solving complex tasks.


Claude Fable 5 model overview


Until now, Mythos-class models were available only through Project Glasswing, a restricted program for a small group of cyber defenders and critical infrastructure providers. With Claude Fable 5, Anthropic is making this level of AI capability available to a much broader audience.


The name "Fable" comes from the Latin word "fabula," meaning "that which is told," and is closely related to the Greek word "mythos." Both Fable and Mythos are based on the same underlying model, but they differ in how they are deployed.


According to Anthropic, Fable 5 achieves state-of-the-art performance across nearly all tested benchmarks, with its advantage becoming even greater as tasks become longer and more complex.


## Key Features and Capabilities


Claude Fable 5 is designed to handle demanding tasks across coding, research, business workflows, and vision. Some of its key capabilities include:


- **Advanced software engineering:** It can write, debug, and refactor code across large codebases. The model can also work autonomously for longer periods, reducing the need for constant user input.
- **Stronger scientific research capabilities:** Fable 5 can analyze complex data, reason through multi-step research problems, generate hypotheses, and support scientific workflows such as protein design and drug discovery.
- **Better knowledge work and analysis:** It performs well on document analysis, financial reasoning, chart and table interpretation, and other tasks that require deep understanding and long-form analysis.
- **Powerful vision capabilities:** The model can understand screenshots, diagrams, scientific figures, and other visual content. It can also extract information from images and even recreate web application code from screenshots.
- **Improved performance on complex tasks:** According to Anthropic, Fable 5's advantage becomes larger as tasks grow longer and more challenging. It is built to maintain context, reason across multiple steps, and stay focused throughout extended workflows.
- **Greater efficiency:** Fable 5 is more token-efficient than previous Claude models, allowing it to complete more work with fewer prompts and interactions.


## Safety Features and Why They Matter


As AI models become more capable, they can also be misused. A model that helps developers find security flaws could also be used to create cyberattacks.


Similarly, a model that supports scientific research could be misused for harmful purposes. This is one of the biggest challenges in releasing powerful AI systems to the public.


To reduce these risks, Anthropic has added a new layer of safety to Claude Fable 5. The model uses classifiers, which are separate AI systems that monitor user requests and detect whether they involve sensitive topics such as cybersecurity, biology, chemistry, or attempts to extract the model's capabilities.


If a request falls into one of these categories, it is not handled by Fable 5. Instead, it is automatically routed to Claude Opus 4.8, Anthropic's next most capable public model. Users are also informed whenever this fallback occurs. According to the company, this happens in less than 5% of sessions on average.


Anthropic says these safeguards will continue to improve over time to reduce unnecessary fallbacks while maintaining safety. This approach allows the company to make a highly capable AI model available to a broader audience without removing protections for high-risk areas.


## Claude Fable 5 vs. Claude Mythos 5


Although Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 are announced as two different models, they are built on the same underlying technology. The main difference lies in how they are deployed and who can access them.


Claude Fable 5 is the public version and includes additional safeguards that make it suitable for general use. Claude Mythos 5 has some of these safeguards lifted, allowing it to handle certain tasks in areas such as cybersecurity and biological research that are considered too sensitive for unrestricted access.


For now, Mythos 5 is available only to a small group of trusted organizations, including partners in Project Glasswing, Anthropic's cyber defense initiative. The company also plans to expand access through a trusted program for selected biology researchers and life science organizations.


Both models have the same pricing of $10 per million input tokens and $50 per million output tokens. However, for most developers and businesses, Claude Fable 5 will be the primary choice, offering Mythos-class capabilities while including the safeguards needed for wider deployment.


## Availability


Claude Fable 5 became available on June 9, 2026, across Anthropic's major platforms. Developers can access it through the Claude API using the model identifier` claude-fable-5` , and it is also available in Claude Code and on major cloud platforms.


The model is included in API and consumption-based Enterprise plans from day one. Anthropic is also rolling it out to Pro, Max, Team, and seat-based Enterprise subscribers, with availability expanding in phases due to high demand.


According to Anthropic, Fable 5 is available at no additional cost through June 22, 2026, after which usage credits will apply for subscription plans. The company has stated that it plans to make Fable 5 a standard part of these plans once additional capacity becomes available.


Claude Mythos 5, however, is not publicly available. It is currently limited to Project Glasswing partners and will gradually expand to a small group of trusted biology researchers through Anthropic's trusted access program.


## Real-World Example


A recent demonstration of Claude Fable 5 shows how far AI-assisted development has progressed. Using a single prompt,["Make a Minecraft clone,"](https://x.com/ChrissGPT/status/2064441716908703780) the model generated a playable game in about 20 minutes.

The project included multiple biomes, a day and night cycle, caves, and ores, features that would normally require significant development effort. The model generated an entire application from a simple instruction and produced much more than a few isolated code snippets.


While this is a demonstration and not a standardized benchmark, it highlights one of Claude Fable 5's key strengths. The model can take a high-level idea, reason through multiple steps, and generate functional software with minimal guidance.


## What This Means for Developers


Claude Fable 5 enables developers to build AI applications that can handle larger and more complex tasks with less manual guidance. Some of its key benefits include:


- **Better coding assistance:** It can write, debug, and work across large codebases while handling longer development tasks.
- **Support for complex workflows:** The model can reason through multi-step research, analysis, and business processes instead of just answering individual questions.
- **Higher productivity:** Developers can automate larger tasks with fewer prompts and less back-and-forth.
- **More capable AI applications:** Its strong reasoning and long-context capabilities make it suitable for building advanced AI agents and enterprise solutions.
- **Greater need for integrations:** As AI models become more powerful, reliable connections to external tools and services become essential for turning their capabilities into real-world applications.


## Why Integration Frameworks Matter


Claude Fable 5 can handle complex reasoning, write code, and complete multi-step workflows. But building a real AI application requires more than a capable model. It also needs reliable connections to the tools and services that businesses use every day.


This is why integration frameworks like[Corsair.dev](https://corsair.dev/) are important. Corsair is an open-source framework that helps developers connect AI applications and agents with services such as GitHub, Slack, Gmail, Notion, and HubSpot through a unified integration layer.

A large part of building these integrations involves managing OAuth, token refresh, webhooks, rate limits, and API changes.


Handling this infrastructure for every service can take significant development effort. Corsair simplifies this process, allowing teams to focus on building product features and AI experiences.


As AI agents begin to work across multiple applications and complete longer workflows, reliable integrations and permission controls become just as important as the model itself. Frameworks like Corsair.dev help developers turn advanced AI capabilities into practical, production-ready applications.


## Conclusion


Claude Fable 5 marks an important step for Anthropic by bringing Mythos-class AI capabilities to a broader audience. With improvements in software engineering, scientific research, knowledge work, and vision, it enables developers and businesses to build more capable AI applications.


At the same time, Anthropic has paired these capabilities with safety measures such as classifiers and fallback mechanisms for sensitive topics. This reflects a balanced approach to making advanced AI more widely available.


For developers, success depends on more than the model itself. Reliable integrations and secure infrastructure are equally important for building production-ready AI applications. Frameworks like Corsair.dev help bridge that gap by connecting AI systems with the tools and services they need to operate effectively.
