# HP Anyware is being sunset: A practical guide for postproduction teams

Unsupported remote infrastructure during an active production can quickly become a security, compliance, and operational problem. As deadlines tighten and remote collaboration remains essential, postproduction teams face increasing pressure to maintain high-performance, secure access to editorial and finishing systems without disrupting artists, editors, or reviewers.


HP has officially ended new-customer sales of HP Anyware.[According to HP’s Trust Center](https://anyware.hp.com/hp-anyware-end-of-life) , the Anyware Trust Center and Trusted Zero Clients reach end of support on October 31, 2026, after which they no longer receive updates or patches; broader HP Anyware support and maintenance continue through October 31, 2029. Teams on multi-year terms may have their own support window with HP.


As with any software past its end-of-support date, running HP Anyware outside these support windows can create security and compliance risk - particularly for workflows handling high quality studio and broadcaster content with content-security[requirements](https://www.ttpn.org/links-resources/) .


This guide explains what the sunset means for 3D development and postproduction workflows, where Parsec fits, and how to plan a low-risk transition without interrupting ongoing productions.


## **What HP Anyware enabled**


Media and entertainment teams widely used HP Anyware to centralize graphics-intensive workstations and provide remote access for editorial, VFX, and finishing workflows. Teams often adopted it for support across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments and for deployments requiring centralized infrastructure.

## **Why Parsec is relevant for editorial and finishing**


[Parsec](https://parsec.app/) originated as low‑latency game streaming technology and now underpins remote post‑production at many studios and facilities.


### **Key characteristics:**


**Low latency and responsiveness**


- Sub‑16 ms added latency with GPU‑side encoding.*
- Up to 4K at 60 fps, with support for 10-bit and 4:4:4 color mode on Windows for color‑critical work.
- Multi‑monitor support (up to three displays) to replicate suite layouts.


**Support for professional tools**


- Wacom and similar tablets with pressure and tilt.
- Precise keyboard and mouse input.
- Controller support where interactive content is part of the workflow.


**Media stays on secure storage**


- Encrypted peer‑to‑peer connections stream frames directly from the GPU buffer on the host to the client.
- Designed so media and project files remain on your infrastructure, not on Parsec’s servers.
- For postproduction teams, Parsec delivers a workstation-quality remote experience for editors and colorists.

## **Parsec vs. HP Anyware: Key differences**


HP Anyware and Parsec both centralize workstations and keep media on secure storage, but the operational experience for editorial teams can differ significantly.


### **Protocol and architecture**


- HP Anyware


- Uses PCoIP pixel remoting from a centralized stack that utilizes CPU. Advanced offloading solutions require additional hardware.
- Requires components such as Connection Manager, Security Gateway, and often load balancers.


- Parsec


- Streams frames peer‑to‑peer (media does not transit Parsec’s infrastructure), using GPU‑side hardware encoding (NVENC, AMF, VideoToolbox).
- Lightweight application install. Uses a proprietary UDP‑based protocol and a single relay application for scalable enterprise firewall support
- Adds sub‑16 ms latency in common creative workflows.


### **Implications in the suite**


- Scrubbing timelines and playing back complex sequences remains responsive.
- Color grading and finishing operations behave closer to local use.
- Supports multi‑monitor and multi-user setups


### **Security and compliance**


- Parsec for Enterprise is SOC 2 Type II certified and compliant with TPN best-practices, with support for SAML 2.0 SSO, SCIM, RBAC, and audit logging.
- Encrypted peer-to-peer connections keep media and project files on centralized storage while enabling integration with existing identity, security, and compliance workflows.
- Unlike a full PCoIP stack, Parsec does not require several separate connection managers or gateways, but makes one lightweight option available for complex enterprise firewall setups.


## **Platform and environment considerations**


Two areas require particular attention when moving from HP Anyware to Parsec:


Linux hosts


Fully air‑gapped environments


### **Linux host support**


- HP Anyware supports Windows,[Linux](https://anyware.hp.com/sites/default/files/2023-09/HP%20Anyware%20Datasheet.pdf) , and macOS as host operating systems.
- Parsec supports Windows and macOS as hosts, with clients on Windows, macOS, Linux, and web. Linux hosts are not supported today.


If your pipeline includes Linux workstations (for example, certain VFX or finishing tools), a typical approach is:


- Use Parsec for Windows and macOS editorial and finishing machines.
- Maintain a separate, Linux‑compatible remote solution for the subset of Linux hosts.


### **Air‑gapped and tightly isolated environments**


- [HP Anyware can be deployed in air‑gapped or tightly controlled environments with no external connectivity.](https://anyware.hp.com/blog/new-hp-anyware-and-anyware-manager-release-offers-enhanced-collaboration-security-and-monitoring#:~:text=Al[%E2%80%A6]r%20gapped)
- Parsec enables encrypted peer‑to‑peer streaming and firewall protected connections via its High Performance Relay. It is not optimized for fully air‑gapped deployments that cannot allow any external connectivity.


Many organizations adopt a hybrid model: Parsec for most critical and performance dependent editorial and review workflows, plus a separate solution for machines that must remain fully isolated or Linux‑only.


## **Parsec for Teams vs. Parsec for Enterprise**


When planning an HP Anyware migration, postproduction facilities can choose between[Parsec for Teams](https://parsec.app/teams) and[Parsec for Enterprise](https://parsec.app/enterprise) .


### **Parsec for Teams**


Suitable for small to mid-sized facilities that:


- Need high-performance remote access for editorial and review workflows.
- Require straightforward administration and SSO integration.
- Work with freelancers, external reviewers, or distributed creative teams.


### **Parsec for Enterprise**


Designed for organizations that:


- Manage larger deployments across multiple sites.
- Require advanced governance, orchestration, compliance, and automation controls.
- Need simplified firewall configuration and reduced VPN dependence through its High Performance Relay (HPR).
- Integrate its remote access infrastructure with existing provisioning systems and SIEM platforms.


Both editions share the same core streaming technology. Enterprise adds controls designed for larger-scale deployments and operational governance.


## **A concise migration plan from HP Anyware to Parsec**


A structured migration helps reduce operational risk and minimize workflow disruption.


### **Step 1: Assess your current deployment**


- List HP Anyware users, host machines (OS, GPU, location), and use cases.
- Identify workloads: i.e. editing, grading, conform, QC, review, broadcast operations.
- Note Linux hosts and any air‑gapped segments.


### **Step 2: Select the appropriate Parsec edition**


- Small to mid‑sized facility? → Parsec for Teams.
- Larger, multi‑site, or compliance‑driven environment? → Parsec for Enterprise. Work with Parsec or a partner to map HP Anyware seats to Parsec licenses and prioritize which hosts move first (typically Windows and macOS editorial machines).


### **Step 3: Deploy Parsec on hosts**


- Install Parsec on Windows or macOS workstations (on‑premises or in the cloud).
- Configure security policies and validate workflows with pilot users.


### **Step 4: Deploy Parsec on clients, onboard users, and run parallel tests**


- Invite users through the Parsec admin panel.
- Install Parsec on end-user computers (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Run HP Anyware and Parsec in parallel for a defined period.
- Ask editors to perform standard tasks in both environments and provide feedback on performance, color, audio, and peripherals.
- Confirm that access and security controls meet internal standards.


### **Step 5: Decommission duplicate solutions where appropriate**


- Remove unused clients and host components from machines that have migrated.
- For Linux or fully air‑gapped hosts, maintain a separate solution if required and document that scope clearly.


## **Next steps**


With so many great reasons to use Parsec, now is the time to plan and execute a transition on your own schedule rather than during a production-critical moment.


Practical next steps:


- Identify Windows and macOS workstations that can move first.
- Decide whether Parsec for Teams or Parsec for Enterprise best aligns with your environment.
- Run a pilot where editors use Parsec alongside HP Anyware and provide structured feedback.


A successful transition is not only about replacing remote access infrastructure. It is about maintaining editorial momentum, reducing workflow interruptions, simplifying remote collaboration, and enabling editors, artists, and reviewers to work together without friction.


For many facilities, Parsec also simplifies onboarding for freelancers and external collaborators while reducing infrastructure complexity.


When you are ready:


- Contact sales@parsec.app to discuss your migration plan, or
- Start a Parsec for Teams trial at parsec.app/signup-team


HP Anyware may be sunsetting, but production schedules, client reviews, and delivery deadlines are not. Parsec helps postproduction teams maintain responsive, secure remote workflows that keep productions moving.
