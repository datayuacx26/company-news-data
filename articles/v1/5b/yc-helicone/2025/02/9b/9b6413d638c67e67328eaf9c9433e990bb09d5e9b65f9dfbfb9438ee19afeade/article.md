## 💡 Latest OpenAI update


As of April 2, Deep Research is now available to all ChatGPT Plus, Teams, Edu, and Enterprise users. There are rumored plans to roll out to Free users in the near future.


OpenAI's release of **Deep Research** came just as the AI community was processing the impact of DeepSeek R1 and its advancements. This timing led many to view it as OpenAI's response to the growing threat of open-source tools like DeepSeek.


Interestingly, OpenAI wasn't the first company to enter the research automation space—Google had already introduced **Gemini Deep Research** shortly before.


Moreover, an open-source alternative to OpenAI's Deep Research emerged[just 12 hours after its release](https://x.com/dzhng/status/1888299647845961909) , gaining positive impressions from the developer community. Less than a month later, **Perplexity Deep Research** was also launched.


In an ocean filled with "deep researchers," OpenAI has introduced a heavyweight contender-one that researches "deeper" than most.


This article takes a close look at OpenAI's Deep Research, examining how it works, its strengths, limitations, benchmark results, and comparisons with the similarly named Gemini Deep Research and Perplexity Deep Research. **Let's see if it truly delivers on its promises.**


## What is OpenAI Deep Research?


Deep Research is an AI-powered automated research agent designed for users who need in-depth analysis of complex topics. Unlike standard LLM outputs that rely on pre-trained knowledge, Deep Research:


- ✅ Accesses and synthesizes real-time web data through online source browsing
- ✅ Conducts multi-step reasoning to answer queries requiring deeper context
- ✅ Generates long-form reports with citations and detailed explanations


### Who should use Deep Research?


Deep Research is designed for professionals in fields that require extensive information retrieval, including:


- **Finance** — Competitive market analysis, investment research
- **Science & Engineering** — Research synthesis, literature reviews
- **Policy & Law** — Legal case studies, policy analysis
- **Business & E-Commerce** — Product comparisons, consumer insights


## 💡 Track your LLM while you wait for API access


While Deep Research isn't API-accessible yet, you can monitor LLMs from all major providers. Get visibility into your app's costs, performance, and usage patterns built with standard LLM APIs.


## How OpenAI Deep Research Works


Deep Research is built on an[OpenAI o3 model](https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o3) that has been optimized for web browsing, data analysis, and multi-step reasoning.


It uses **end-to-end reinforcement learning** to handle complex search and synthesis tasks, effectively combining LLM reasoning capabilities with real-time web browsing.


Here is how it works:


1. **Query Interpretation & Clarification**


- Deep Research analyzes the user's query and requests clarifications when needed (e.g., specific location for price comparisons)


2. **Web Scraping & Data Extraction**


- Retrieves and processes top-ranked search results
- Extracts relevant information from multiple sources


3. **Analysis & Synthesis**


- Summarizes findings and identifies patterns
- Performs multi-document summarization with citation tracking
- Analyzes and visualizes tabular data and figures using Python


4. **Report Generation**


- Creates structured reports with proper citations
- Incorporates generated images, tables, and charts


## OpenAI Deep Research Benchmark Results


According to[OpenAI's official results](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) , the Deep Research model significantly outperforms previous models on key benchmarks.


### Humanity's Last Exam


Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) is a rigorous AI benchmark that evaluates LLMs across a broad range of expert-level academic subjects.


The[Humanity's Last Exam](https://lastexam.ai/) encompasses disciplines including classics, ecology, law, and mathematics, testing how well AI systems handle questions that challenge even seasoned domain experts.


This benchmark measures accuracy on "Expert-Level" questions across more than 100 subjects.


Model Accuracy (%)


**OpenAI Deep Research** **26.6**


**Perplexity Deep Research** **21.1**


OpenAI o3-mini (high) 13.0


DeepSeek-R1 9.4


OpenAI o1 9.1


Gemini Thinking 6.2


Claude 3.5 Sonnet 4.3


Grok-2 3.8


GPT-4o 3.3


### GAIA Benchmark


GAIA (General AI Assistant Benchmark) is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess AI assistants on real-world problem-solving tasks. **[GAIA](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fibxvahvs3)** evaluates an AI system's capabilities in complex reasoning, multimodal input processing, web browsing, and tool utilization.


Model Configuration Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Avg. Accuracy


[Previous top results](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) 67.92 67.44 42.31 63.64


**Deep Research** **78.66** **73.21** **58.03** **72.57**


Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that focus on professional skill-based evaluations, GAIA challenges AI systems with tasks that humans find straightforward but remain challenging for current models.


For example, while GPT-4 with plugins achieves only` 15%` accuracy, human respondents score` 92%` , highlighting a significant gap in AI performance on practical, reasoning-based tasks.


## OpenAI Deep Research: Strengths & Limitations


Strengths Limitations


✔️ **Detailed Summarization** : Effectively extracts and synthesizes complex concepts 🆇 **Hallucinations** : May fabricate sources, misinterpret data, or cite incorrect facts—which can be hidden in lengthy reports


✔️ **Data Accuracy** : References are consistently accurate, especially for structured data 🆇 **Information Consistency** : Can produce contradictory information, show bias, or reference outdated data


✔️ **Query Processing** : Effectively refines and processes multi-step queries 🆇 **Original Analysis** : Struggles with generating novel hypotheses or interpreting nuanced academic discussions


✔️ **Time Efficiency** : Reduces hours of manual research to minutes with high-quality sources


## OpenAI Deep Research vs. Gemini Deep Research vs. Perplexity Deep Research


Let's compare OpenAI Deep Research with Gemini Deep Research and Perplexity Deep Research (launched in February 2025).


### TL;DR


- OpenAI Deep Research offers the most powerful capabilities but comes at a premium price; ideal for technical and academic research
- **[Google's Deep Research](https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/)** provides a more affordable option but is susceptible to SEO-driven biases and citation inaccuracies
- **[Perplexity Deep Research](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research)** delivers the fastest results and includes a free tier, making it perfect for quick, structured research with reliable citations


### Detailed Comparison: OpenAI Deep Research Pricing & Features


OpenAI Google Perplexity


**Cost** $200/month $20/month Free (5 queries/day) or $20/month


**Level of Detail** Comprehensive, detailed reports Concise reports Structured, concise summaries


**Search Sources** Websites and academic papers Primarily website content Academic papers and real-time data


**Accuracy** High accuracy with occasional errors More susceptible to SEO bias High accuracy, slightly below OpenAI


**Citation Quality** Generally reliable with some errors Occasionally cites unrelated sources Consistently reliable citations


**Best Use Cases** Technical and academic research General web research Research, journalism, real-time analysis


**Input Support** Text, images, PDFs, spreadsheets Primarily text-based Text queries, limited file handling


**Output Format** Detailed reports with sources and visuals Reports with key findings Concise summaries with inline citations


**Process Transparency** Shows detailed reasoning steps Uses predetermined research paths Displays reasoning and search progression


**Processing Time** 5-30 minutes per query Under 15 minutes 2-4 minutes per query


OpenAI Deep Research is more capable and feature-packed, but so far, all the models struggle with reliability. In any case, you must understand its limitations and be prepared to work with them.


## Is OpenAI's Deep Research Worth It?


The value of OpenAI's Deep Research depends on your specific needs.


Recommended for Not Recommended for


✔️ Researchers working on complex, niche topics
