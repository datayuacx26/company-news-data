# Ubuntu Docker Support in Cua with Kasm

*Published Aug 26, 2025 by Francesco Bonacci*


Today we’re shipping **Ubuntu Docker support** in Cua. You get a full Linux desktop inside a Docker container, viewable right in your browser—no VM spin-up, no extra clients. It behaves the same on macOS, Windows, and Linux.


## Why we did this


If you build automation or RL workflows with Cua, you’ve probably run into the usual platform walls: macOS VMs (via Lume) are Apple-Silicon only; Windows Sandbox needs Pro/Enterprise; giving agents your host desktop is… exciting, but risky; and little OS quirks make “build once, run anywhere” harder than it should be.


We wanted something lightweight, isolated, and identical across machines. So we put a desktop in a container.


## Why we didn’t use QEMU/KVM


Short answer: **portability, startup time, and ops friction.**


- **Runs everywhere, no hypervisor drama.** KVM needs Linux; Hyper-V/Virtualization.Framework setups vary by host and policy. Docker is ubiquitous across macOS/Windows/Linux and allowed in most CI runners—so your GUI env actually runs where your team works.
- **Faster boot & smaller footprints.** Containers cold-start in seconds and images are GB-scale; VMs tend to be minutes and tens of GB. That matters for parallel agents, CI, and local iteration.
- **Lower ops overhead.** No nested virt, kernel modules, or privileged host tweaks that many orgs (and cloud runners) block. Pull → run → browser.
- **Same image, everywhere.** One Docker image gives you an identical desktop on every dev laptop and in CI.
- **Web-first access out of the box.** KasmVNC serves the desktop over HTTP—no extra VNC/RDP clients or SPICE config.


**When we *do* reach for QEMU/KVM:**


- You need **true OS isolation** or to run **non-Linux** guests.
- You want **kernel-level features** or **device/GPU passthrough** (VFIO).
- You’re optimizing for **hardware realism** over startup speed and density.


For this release, the goal was a **cross-platform Linux desktop that feels instant and identical** across local dev and CI. Containers + KasmVNC hit that sweet spot.


## What we built


Under the hood it’s **KasmVNC + Ubuntu 22.04 (Xfce) in Docker** , pre-configured for computer-use automation. You get a proper GUI desktop served over HTTP (no VNC/RDP client), accessible from any modern browser. Cua’s Computer server boots automatically so your agents can connect immediately.


### How it works (at a glance)


```text
Your System
└─ Docker Container
└─ Xfce Desktop + KasmVNC → open in your browser


```


## Quick start


1.


**Install Docker** — Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or Docker Engine (Linux).


2.


**Pull or build the image**


```text
bash   # Pull (recommended)  docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 trycua/cua-ubuntu:latest     # Or build locally  cd libs/kasm  docker build -t cua-ubuntu:latest .
```


1. **Run with Cua’s Computer SDK**


```text
python   from computer import Computer     computer = Computer(      os_type="linux",      provider_type="docker",      image="trycua/cua-ubuntu:latest",      name="my-automation-container"  )     await computer.run()
```


### Make an agent that drives this desktop


```text
python   from cua_agent import ComputerAgent     # assumes `computer` is the instance created above  agent = ComputerAgent("openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.5v", tools=[computer])     async for _ in agent.run("Click on the search bar and type 'hello world'"):      pass
```


> Use any VLM with tool use; just make sure your OpenRouter creds are set.


By default you land on **Ubuntu 22.04 + Xfce** with a browser and desktop basics, the **Computer server** is running, the **web viewer** is available at` http://localhost:8006` , and common automation tools are preinstalled.


## What’s inside (in plain English)


A tidy Linux desktop with web access through **KasmVNC** , Python 3.11 and dev tools, plus utilities you’ll actually use for automation—` wmctrl` for windows,` xclip` for clipboard,` ffmpeg` for media, screenshot helpers, and so on. It starts as a **non-root` kasm-user`** , lives in an **isolated filesystem** (unless you mount volumes), and ships with **SSL off for local dev** so you terminate TLS upstream when you deploy.


## How it compares


Feature KasmVNC Docker Lume (macOS VM) Windows Sandbox


Platform support macOS, Windows, Linux macOS (Apple Silicon) Windows Pro/Enterprise


Resource usage Low (container) Medium (full VM) Medium (full VM)


Setup time ~30s 2–5 min 1–2 min


GUI desktop Linux macOS Windows


Web access Browser (no client) Typically VNC client Typically RDP client


Consistency Same everywhere Hardware-dependent OS-dependent


**Use KasmVNC Docker when…** you want the **same GUI env across devs/CI/platforms** , you’re doing **RL or end-to-end GUI tests** , or you need **many isolated desktops on one machine** . **Use alternatives when…** you need native **macOS** (→ Lume) or native **Windows** (→ Windows Sandbox).


## Using the Agent Framework (parallel example)


A compact pattern for running multiple desktops and agents side-by-side:


```text
python   import asyncio  from computer import Computer  from cua_agent import ComputerAgent     # Create multiple computer instances (each gets its own desktop)  computers = []  for i in range(3):      c = Computer(          os_type="linux",          provider_type="docker",          image="trycua/cua-ubuntu:latest",          name=f"parallel-desktop-{i}"      )      computers.append(c)      await c.run()     # Pair each desktop with a task  tasks = [      "open github and search for 'trycua/cua'",      "open a text editor and write 'hello world'",      "open the browser and go to google.com",  ]     agents = [      ComputerAgent(model="openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.5v", tools=[c])      for c in computers  ]     async def run_agent(agent, task):      async for _ in agent.run(task):          pass     await asyncio.gather(*[run_agent(a, t) for a, t in zip(agents, tasks)])
```


## What’s next


We’re polishing a **CLI to push/scale these containers on Cua Cloud** , exploring **GPU acceleration** for in-container inference, and publishing **prebuilt images** for Playwright, Selenium, and friends.


## Try it


```text
python   from computer import Computer  computer = Computer(os_type="linux", provider_type="docker", image="trycua/cua-ubuntu:latest")  await computer.run()
```
