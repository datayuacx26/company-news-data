# Supabase Wrappers v0.2: Query Pushdown & Remote Subqueries

Supabase Wrappers v0.2 is out and now available on the Supabase platform. Wrappers is a Postgres extension that provides integrations with external sources so you can interact with third-party data using SQL.


`

**Key Features and Improvements in Wrappers v0.2:**


- New Wrappers
- Query Pushdown
- Remote Subqueries
- Usage Statistics


To start using Wrappers on the Supabase platform, check out the[Wrappers docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/wrappers/overview) .


## New Wrappers and Improvements#


- [Airtable](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/wrappers/airtable) (Read-only): query your Airtable bases with[support for jsonb](https://github.com/supabase/wrappers/pull/181)
- [AWS S3](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/wrappers/s3) (Read-only): with support for CSV, JSON, and Parquet
- [Clerk](https://github.com/tembo-io/clerk_fdw) (from the team at[Tembo](https://tembo.io/) ). Not yet available on our platform since it is a community wrapper, see below for details.
- And a WIP Wrapper for[Auth0](https://github.com/supabase/wrappers/pull/183)


We cannot support community Wrappers inside the Supabase Dashboard until the Wrappers API is stabilized. You can vote your favorite Wrapper if you'd like it to be added to Supabase in the future. If you have developed a Wrapper that you want inside the Supabase Dashboard, please contribute it as a PR in[the wrappers repo](https://github.com/supabase/wrappers) . Once we release Wrappers 1.0, we will support community Wrappers within the Supabase Dashboard.


More improvements and updates can be found on[Wrappers release page](https://github.com/supabase/wrappers/releases) , including support for Query Pushdown, Remote Subqueries, and Usage Statistics which we’ll explore below.


## Support for Query Pushdown#


The Wrappers v0.2 framework now supports Query Pushdown.


### What is Query Pushdown?#


Query pushdown is a technique that enhances query performance by executing parts of the query directly on the data source. It reduces data transfer between the database and the application, enabling faster execution and improved performance.


### How to Use Query Pushdown in Wrappers#


In Wrappers, the pushdown logic is integrated into each extension. You don’t need to modify your queries to benefit from this feature. For example, the[Stripe FDW](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/wrappers/stripe) automatically applies query pushdown for` id` within the` customer` object:


`
_10


select *


_10


from stripe.customers


_10


where id = 'cus_N5WMk7pvQPkY3B';


`


This approach contrasts with fetching and filtering all customers locally, which is less efficient. Query pushdown translates this into a single API call, significantly speeding up the process:


`
_10


https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/cus_N5WMk7pvQPkY3B


`


We can use push down criteria and other query parameters too. For example,[ClickHouse FDW](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/wrappers/clickhouse) supports` order by` and` limit` pushdown:


`
_10


select *


_10


from clickhouse.people


_10


order by name


_10


limit 20;


`


This query executes` order by name limit 20` on ClickHouse before transferring the result to Postgres.


For details on where pushdown is supported, consult each FDW's documentation in the[Wrappers Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/wrappers/overview) .


## Remote Subqueries#


Remote subqueries enable the use of prepared data on a remote server, which is beneficial for complex queries or sensitive data protection.


### Static Subqueries#


In its most basic form, you can map a query on the remote server into a foreign table in Postgres. For instance:


`
_10


create foreign table clickhouse.people (


_10


id bigint,


_10


name text,


_10


age bigint


_10


)


_10


server clickhouse_server


_10


options (


_10


table '(select * from people where age < 25)'


_10


);


`


In this example, the foreign table` clickhouse.people` data is read from the result of the subquery` select * from people where age < 25` which runs on ClickHouse server.


### Dynamic Subqueries#


What if the query is not fixed and needs to be dynamic? For example, ClickHouse provides[Parameterized Views](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/view#parameterized-view) which can accept parameters for a view. Wrappers v0.2 supports this by defining a column for each parameter. Let's take a look at an example:


`
_11


create foreign table clickhouse.my_table (


_11


id bigint,


_11


col1 text,


_11


col2 bigint,


_11


_param1 text,


_11


_param2 bigint


_11


)


_11


server clickhouse_server


_11


options (


_11


table '(select * from my_view(column1=${_param1}, column2=${_param2}))'


_11


);


`


You can then pass values to these parameters in your query:


`
_10


select id, col1, col2


_10


from clickhouse.my_table


_10


where _param1 = 'abc' and _param2 = 42;


`


Currently, this feature is supported by[ClickHouse FDW](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/wrappers/clickhouse) and[BigQuery FDW](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/wrappers/bigquery) , with plans to expand support in the future.


## FDW Usage Statistics#


Quantitative metrics play a pivotal role when working with Postgres FDWs because of their impact on performance optimisation, monitoring, and query planning across distributed databases. We introduced a FDW usage statistics table` wrappers_fdw_stats` in Wrappers v0.2, storing:


- ` create_times` - number of times the FDW instance has been created
- ` rows_in` - number of rows transferred from source
- ` rows_out` - number of rows transferred to source
- ` bytes_in` - number of bytes transferred from source
- ` bytes_out` - number of bytes transferred to source
- ` metadata` - additional usage statistics specific to a FDW


We can use these to identify bottlenecks, latency issues, and inefficiencies in data retrieval. Access this table on the Supabase platform using the following:


`
_10


select *


_10


from extensions.wrappers_fdw_stats;


`
