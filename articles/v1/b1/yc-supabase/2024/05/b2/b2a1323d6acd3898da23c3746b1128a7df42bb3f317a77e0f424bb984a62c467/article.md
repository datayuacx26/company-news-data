# What's new in pgvector v0.7.0

Real-world embedding datasets often contain redundancy buried within the vector space. For example, when vectors cluster around certain central points in a multidimensional space, it reveals an exploitable structure. By reducing this redundancy, we can achieve memory and performance savings with a minimal impact on precision. Several approaches to leverage this idea have been introduced in pgvector since version 0.7.0:


- float16 vector representation
- sparse vectors
- bit vectors


### Float16 vectors#


An HNSW index is most efficient when it fits into shared memory and avoids being evicted due to concurrent operations, which Postgres performs to minimize costly I/O operations. Historically, pgvector supported only 32-bit vectors. In version 0.7.0, pgvector introduces 16-bit float HNSW indexes which consume exactly half the memory. That reduction in memory keeps operations at maximum performance for twice as long.


There are two options when using float16 vectors:


- Index using float16, but the underlying table continues to use float32
- The index and the underlying table both use float16. This options uses 50% as much disk space in addition to requiring 50% less shared memory to operate efficiently. Performance is further improved with more vectors fitting in a single Postgres page and with fewer page evictions due to concurrent operations.


To duplicate an existing float32 embedding table to float16 one:


`
_11


create table embedding_half (


_11


id serial,


_11


vector halfvec(1536),


_11


primary key (id)


_11


);


_11


_11


insert into embedding_half (vector)


_11


select


_11


vector::halfvec(1536)


_11


from


_11


embedding_full;


`


With 900K OpenAI 1536-dimensional vectors, the table size is 3.5Gb. For comparison,` embedding_full` required 7Gb.


Then we can build a float16 HNSW index:


`
_10


create index on embedding_half using hnsw (vector halfvec_l2_ops);


`


To test the performance of index creation, we chose a` c7g.metal` instance with 128Gb memory and the following parameters:


`
_10


shared_buffers = 50000MB


_10


maintenance_work_mem = 30000MB


_10


max_parallel_maintenance_workers = {0-63}


_10


wal_level=minimal


_10


max_wal_size = 10GB


_10


autovacuum = off


_10


full_page_writes = off


_10


fsync = off


`


HNSW build times recently experienced a stepwise improvement in the 0.6.2 release, which introduced parallel builds. 0.7.0 with the halfvec (float16) feature improves that speedup a further 30%.


Note that float16 vector arithmetic on the ARM architecture is identical to float32, so serial build times (with one parallel worker) have not improved. However there is a significant difference for parallel builds due to better pages and I/O utilization. Also note that this test doesn't use pre-warming or other artificial enhancements.


Both heap and HNSW relations for float16 occupy only half of the space compared to the previous float32 ones.


There is a proposal to speed it up even more in the future by using SVE intrinsics on ARM architecture (see:[https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/pull/536](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/pull/536) ).


Jonathan Katz[made his measurements](https://jkatz05.com/post/postgres/pgvector-performance-150x-speedup) on HNSW performance using` r7gd.16xlarge` (64 vCPU, 512GiB RAM), and his results are even better. For float16, HNSW build times are up to 3x faster. For select’s performance, ANN benchmark results show that precision is not changed with decreasing bitness, and queries per second (QPS) is similar to in-memory cases. But when real machine queries are using I/O or some HNSW pages are evicted from memory due to concurrent connections, there would be a meaningful difference. With only half of memory needed to accommodate the same HNSW index, cost for the same performance and precision is also significantly less.

### Sparse vectors#


If vectors contain many zero components, then a sparse vector representation can save significant storage space. For example, to populate sparse vectors:


`
_10


create embedding_sparse (


_10


id serial,


_10


vector sparsevec(1536),


_10


primary key (id)


_10


)


_10


_10


insert into embedding_sparse (embedding) values ('{1:0.1,3:0.2,5:0.3}/1536'), ('{1:0.4,3:0.5,5:0.6}/1536');


`


The sparse vector only consumes storage space for the non-zero components. In this case, thats 3 values in a 1536 vector.


Note the new vector syntax` {1:3,3:1,5:2}/1536` for the sparse vector representation in:


`
_10


select * from embedding_sparse order by vector <-> '{1:3,3:1,5:2}/1536' limit 5;


`


### Bit vectors#


Using binary quantization we can represent float vector as a vector in binary space. This reduces storage size dramatically and is intended as a way to quickly “pre-select” from a data set before performing an additional search within the subset. When properly parameterized, the secondary select can be very fast, even without an index.


`
_10


create index on embedding


_10


using hnsw ((binary_quantize(vector)::bit(1000)) bit_hamming_ops);


_10


_10


select


_10


*


_10


from


_10


embedding


_10


order by


_10


binary_quantize(vector)::bit(3) <~> binary_quantize('\[1,-2,3\]')


_10


limit 5;


`


To use a binary quantized HNSW index to pre-select from a larger dataset and then make a fast selection from the resulting subset, without an index:


`
_12


select * from (


_12


select


_12


*


_12


from


_12


embedding


_12


order by


_12


binary_quantize(vector)::bit(3) <~> binary_quantize('\[1,-2,3\]')


_12


limit 20


_12


)


_12


order by


_12


vector <=> '\[1,-2,3\]'


_12


limit 5;


`


It allows building a small and fast HNSW index for select, insert, or update operations while still having fast vector search. Exact configuration for the` limit` clauses are data dependent, so you’ll want to experiment with the sub-select size and the number of final results directly on your own dataset.


### New distance functions#


pgvector 0.7.0 also added support for L1 distance operator` <+>` .


And new distance types for indexing:


[L1 distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) - added in 0.7.0


`
_10


create index on items using hnsw (embedding vector_l1_ops);


`


[Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) - added in 0.7.0


`
_10


create index on items using hnsw (embedding bit_hamming_ops);


`


[Jaccard distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) - added in 0.7.0


`
_10


create index on vector using hnsw (vector bit_jaccard_ops);


`


### Conclusion#


Over the last year pgvector has had significant development in both functionality and performance, including HNSW indexes, parallel builds, and many other options. With the introduction of half vectors (float16), sparse vectors, and bit vectors, we're now seeing over 100x speedup compared to one year ago.

If you are unsure which version of pgvector your project is using, search for` vector` on the[Extensions page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/extensions) . If you are using a previous version, you can upgrade by navigating to the **Service Versions** section on the[Infrastructure page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/infrastructure) and upgrading your Postgres version to` 15.1.1.47` or later.
