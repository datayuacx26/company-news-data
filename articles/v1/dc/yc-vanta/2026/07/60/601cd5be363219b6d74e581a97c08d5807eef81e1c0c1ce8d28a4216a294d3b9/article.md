Package: Plus, Professional, Enterprise (Modular)


**Control Assessments in Audits**


-


Users (auditors) can now formally assess controls directly in Vanta on both internal and external IRL audits, assigning framework-specific assessment statuses such as Conforming or Non-conformity for ISO, or Satisfied or Not Satisfied for FedRAMP, with every assessment requiring a justification stored as a comment on the control. Package: Professional, Enterprise (Modular)


**Internal Auditor Role**


-


Users can now designate an internal employee as the auditor on an internal audit engagement without requiring an external audit firm, giving that employee an auditor-scoped view of the IRL, request tracker, and population views scoped only to their assigned audit, while keeping them clearly distinguished from external auditors in all system data. Package: Professional, Enterprise (Modular)


**Custom Commitment Types (MVP)**


-


Users can now define their own commitment types by giving each type a name, a short definition, and optional example clauses, with Vanta automatically extracting that type from every future contract and retroactively applying it to all previously uploaded contracts with no re-uploading required. Package: Customer Commitments


**Assign Control Owners via Agentic Control Program Onboarding**
