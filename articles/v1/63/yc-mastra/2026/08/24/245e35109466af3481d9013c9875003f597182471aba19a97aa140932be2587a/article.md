# Context engineering for AI agents: a practical guide

You wired up an agent that answered perfectly in testing, then watched it forget instructions, cite stale data, and burn tokens once real conversations ran long. The prompt did not change. What changed was everything else the model saw: tool outputs, retrieved documents, conversation history, and accumulated state. That surrounding information is context, and managing it deliberately is context engineering.


Andrej Karpathy popularized the framing that an LLM behaves like a CPU while its[context window](https://www.langchain.com/blog/context-engineering-for-agents) acts as RAM. Your job is to load the right working set into that limited memory at every step.[Anthropic reported](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system) that multi-agent setups with isolated contexts outperformed single-agent systems on complex research tasks. Building capable agents turned out to be less about wording and more about curation.


This guide covers what is context engineering in AI, how it compares with prompt engineering, the core strategies for managing context, and how to evaluate whether your agent is getting what it needs.


## What is context engineering?


Context engineering is the practice of curating and maintaining the optimal set of tokens an LLM sees during inference. That includes the initial prompt, but also the tool definitions, retrieved documents, memory, message history, and structured inputs you pass in. The goal is to find the smallest set of high-signal tokens that reliably produces the behavior you want.


The term rose to prominence as teams moved from single-shot prompts to agents running over many turns. Shopify CEO[Tobi Lutke](https://thegenios.com/blog/karpathy-on-memory-and-context/) described it as the art of providing all the context needed for a task to be plausibly solvable. That reframing matters. It shifts the work from wordsmithing toward system design.


It is now a defining concern across AI engineering broadly, shaping how teams think about every LLM call in a pipeline.


### Context vs. the context window


Your context and your context window are related but distinct. The context window is the fixed token capacity a model can attend to in a single inference call. Context is the actual information you choose to place inside that window. One is a hard constraint set by the model. The other is a design decision you make on every turn.


That distinction drives most practical decisions in agentic systems. You rarely have room for everything relevant, so you decide what earns a slot. As an agent runs in a loop, it generates more data that could matter next, and you refine that pool continuously rather than once.


### What context includes in machine learning systems


When you build with LLMs, context spans several categories that each need handling:


-


**Instructions:** system prompts, few-shot examples, and tool descriptions


-


**Knowledge:** facts, retrieved documents, and memories


-


**Tool feedback:** the results the agent pulls back mid-task


Each category competes for the same finite window, and each plays a distinct role in how machine learning models produce useful output.


Grouping context this way helps you reason about tradeoffs. Instructions steer behavior, knowledge grounds answers, and tool feedback drives the next decision. When you treat all three as one undifferentiated blob, you lose the ability to tune them independently, which is where most context management problems begin.


## Context engineering vs. prompt engineering


If you have done prompt engineering, you already know part of this work. Prompt engineering focuses on writing and organizing instructions, especially the system prompt, to get good one-shot results. It remains a real skill, and it sits inside the larger discipline rather than being replaced by it.


Context engineering is the natural progression. A prompt is discrete: you write it once and reuse it. Context is iterative: the curation step repeats every time you decide what to pass the model. As generative AI applications moved from single-shot prompts to multi-turn agents, teams needed strategies for the whole state, not just the opening instruction.


The table below contrasts the two approaches so you can see where each applies.


**Dimension** **Prompt engineering** **Context engineering**


Primary focus Wording of instructions Full set of tokens at inference


Scope System and user prompts Prompts, tools, memory, retrieval, state


Cadence Written once, reused Curated on every turn


Failure mode Ambiguous instructions Context rot, distraction, clash


Best fit Single-shot tasks Multi-turn agents


A useful way to hold both in mind: prompt engineering asks what you should say, and context engineering asks what the model should see. The second question subsumes the first once your system runs autonomously.


## Why context engineering matters for capable agents


Your agents fail in ways that traditional software does not, and most of those failures trace back to context. The classic principle applies here: garbage in, garbage out. A model can return a confident, well-formatted answer that is wrong because it attended to stale or conflicting information.


Getting context right is how you prevent that class of bug before it reaches users. Even as context windows grow, larger is not automatically better.


Models draw on a limited attention budget, and every token you add spends some of it. Treating context as a precious, finite resource is the mental shift that separates agents that hold up in production from demos that fall apart on turn twenty.


### The context window challenge and token limits


You hit context window limits faster than you expect once tool outputs start accumulating. A single verbose search result or a large file dump can consume thousands of tokens, and agents call tools repeatedly. Cost and latency climb with every token, so an unmanaged window is both a correctness problem and a budget problem.


The underlying cause is architectural. Transformers let every token attend to every other token, producing n² pairwise relationships. As sequences grow, the LLM stretches its attention thinner, and precision on retrieval and long-range reasoning degrades. This is a gradient, not a cliff, but the gradient is real and shows up in production.


### Context rot and degradation over long runs


You will eventually meet context rot: as the token count rises, the model’s ability to accurately recall retrieved information from the window drops. Needle-in-a-haystack benchmarks surface this clearly. Every model exhibits some degradation, though the severity varies, so the safe assumption is that more tokens can mean worse recall.


Several named context failures compound over long runs:


-


**Context poisoning:** a hallucination enters the window and gets treated as fact


-


**Context distraction:** accumulated history overwhelms the model’s training


-


**Context confusion:** superfluous content sways the answer


-


**Context clash:** parts of the context disagree with each other


## The anatomy of effective context


You gain the most control by treating each component of context as its own tuning surface. Good context engineering means finding the minimal high-signal set for each part, then assembling them so the model sees a coherent whole. The sections below walk through the components you control on every turn.


### Prompt design and instructions


Your instructions should sit at the right altitude: specific enough to guide behavior, general enough to leave the model room to reason. Two failure modes bracket that zone. Hardcoded if-else logic makes prompts brittle and hard to maintain. Vague high-level guidance leaves the LLM without concrete signals for the output you want.


You should organize system instructions into clear sections using headers or tags for background, instructions, tool guidance, and output format. A minimal example looks like this:


```text
## Background
You are a research planning agent...
## Instructions
- Break user queries into 2-5 subtasks
- Assign each subtask a priority from 1 to 5
## Output format
Return a JSON object with fields: id, query, priority, date_range


```


Start with a lean prompt on your strongest model, then add examples targeting the specific failures you observe.


### User input and output schemas


You shape the user’s input as much as you receive it. Wrapping raw input in delimiters removes ambiguity about where the query starts and what you expect back. This small structuring step prevents a surprising amount of confusion when inputs contain their own formatting or instructions.


Structured output matters just as much when one agent feeds the next. Passing a schema or a JSON object example tells the model exactly what fields and types to return. Without that, an agent might grade priority on a 1-to-10 scale when the next step expects 1-to-5, breaking the handoff. Most frameworks provide this capability natively.


### Tools and tool definitions


Your tools define the contract between the agent and its environment, so they deserve the same care as a public API. Each tool should be self-contained, robust to error, and unambiguous about when to use it. Return token-efficient results, because verbose tool output is one of the fastest ways to flood a window.


The most common failure here is a bloated tool set with overlapping functions. If a human engineer cannot say with confidence which tool fits a situation, the agent will not do better. Curating a minimal viable tool set improves selection accuracy and makes long-run context easier to prune later.


### Memory and conversation history


You manage two kinds of memory. Short-term memory holds the current session’s conversation history and working state. Long-term memory persists facts and preferences across sessions, often in a vector database or knowledge graphs. Both feed context, and both need selective retrieval so you surface only what the current task requires.


Memory selection is genuinely hard. Pull too little and the agent forgets. Pull too much and you invite distraction or an awkward injection of irrelevant detail. Working memory patterns, where an agent maintains a compact running summary, help keep the active set tight while longer records stay retrievable on demand.[Mastra's guide to agent memory](https://mastra.ai/articles/agent-memory) breaks down these tradeoffs across short-term buffers, working memory, and long-term recall.


### Retrieved knowledge and grounding


RAG grounds your agent in external data it was never trained on. A typical retrieval augmented generation pipeline splits documents through chunking, converts chunks to embeddings, and stores them for semantic search. At query time you retrieve the closest matches and place them in context so the model answers from real sources rather than guessing.


Retrieval quality is a core context engineering challenge, not a solved one. Indexing code or documents is not the same as retrieving the right context. Production retrieval systems often combine keyword search, vector similarity, and a reranking step, because semantic matching alone becomes unreliable as your corpus grows.


## Core context engineering strategies


You can organize almost every context tactic into four buckets: write, select, compress, and isolate. This framing, popularized by the LangChain team, gives you a checklist for where to intervene when an agent’s context gets unwieldy. Each strategy targets a different phase of the agent’s loop.


### Write context


You save information outside the window so the agent can use it later. Scratchpads are the simplest form: the agent writes notes to a file or a state field mid-task and reads them back when needed. This keeps the active window lean while preserving anything the agent might reference later.


Memories extend the same idea across sessions. You can have an agent reflect after each turn and persist what it learned, then retrieve those notes on future runs. Many code assistants use a small always-loaded rules file for procedural memory, which is a lightweight write strategy you can adopt immediately.


### Select context


You pull the right information into the window at each step. For scratchpads and state, you decide which fields to expose per turn. For memory collections, you retrieve the entries relevant to the current task, which grows harder as the collection grows.


Tool selection is a form of context selection too. When an agent has many tools, applying retrieval over tool descriptions surfaces only the relevant few, and[research has shown](https://www.langchain.com/blog/context-engineering-for-agents) this can improve tool selection accuracy several times over. The same discipline you apply to documents applies to tools.


### Compress context


You keep only the tokens a task actually needs. Summarization is the common lever: when a conversation nears the window limit, you distill it into a high-fidelity summary and continue from there. Coding assistants that auto-compact long sessions demonstrate this at scale.


Trimming is the blunter cousin of summarization. Rather than distilling with an LLM, you filter or prune with heuristics, such as dropping the oldest messages or clearing raw tool results once they have been consumed. Trimming is cheap and safe when you know which content has outlived its usefulness.


### Isolate context


You split context so no single window has to hold everything. Sub-agents are the most common approach: each handles a focused sub-task with its own clean window and returns a condensed summary to a coordinating agent. Detailed exploration stays contained, and the lead agent synthesizes distilled results.


State objects and sandboxed environments isolate context too. You can store token-heavy tool outputs in a state field and expose them to the model only when required. Code-based agents can hold large objects as variables in a sandbox, passing back only the values that matter, which keeps binary or bulky data out of the window entirely.


## Context retrieval and agentic search


Your retrieval strategy shapes how much the agent knows at any moment. Early agentic apps leaned on embedding-based retrieval computed before inference. The field is now shifting toward runtime approaches where the agent decides what to load as it works, closer to how a person navigates a filesystem than how a search index returns matches.


### Enabling dynamic knowledge access


You give an agent dynamic access by handing it lightweight references rather than the full payload. File paths, stored queries, and links let the agent load data on demand instead of pre-loading everything. Metadata on those references carries signal too: a filename, a folder, or a timestamp hints at relevance before the agent ever opens the file.


This mirrors human cognition. You do not memorize an entire codebase. You keep an index and retrieve on demand. Letting agents explore progressively means each interaction yields context that informs the next decision, so the agent assembles understanding layer by layer while keeping the working window focused.


### Query augmentation and just-in-time retrieval


Query augmentation improves what you retrieve before you retrieve it. Giving the agent the current date and time, for example, lets it infer accurate date ranges instead of guessing, which sharpens every downstream search. Small context additions like this often produce outsized gains in retrieval quality.


Just-in-time retrieval trades speed for freshness. Runtime exploration is slower than serving pre-computed results, but it avoids stale indexes and lets the agent chase only what the task demands. Many strong agents use a hybrid: drop a small stable set into context up front, then explore autonomously for the rest.


### Databases and data formats for retrieval


Your storage choices shape retrieval quality. A vector database supports semantic search over embeddings and suits fuzzy, meaning-based lookups. Knowledge graphs capture explicit relationships and suit queries where structure matters. Plain files and SQL still earn their place when access patterns are predictable and exact matches beat similarity.


Data format decisions cascade into cost and response time. Verbose formats inflate token counts on every retrieval, so trimming fields and returning compact records pays off across thousands of calls. Caching frequent lookups avoids regenerating results you already have, which lowers both cost and latency.


## Context engineering with Mastra


If you build AI agents in TypeScript,[Mastra](https://mastra.ai/ai-agent-framework) gives you the primitives context engineering depends on in one open-source framework. Its memory system separates working memory from long-term recall, so you keep the active window lean while persisting facts across sessions. Its workflow engine lets you chain and branch steps, which is the backbone of compaction and sub-agent isolation.


*Mastra Studio surfaces an agent’s tools, memory, and workflow steps so you can inspect the context each step assembles.*


Retrieval and model access come built in. The retrieval pipeline handles chunking and reranking, while the model router reaches **90+** providers through one interface, so you can pick a cheap model for compaction and a stronger one for reasoning. Traces and evals ship alongside, closing the loop between assembling context and measuring it.


Memory gets the same treatment.[Mastra’s Observational Memory](https://mastra.ai/blog/observational-memory) compresses conversation history into dense observation logs instead of replaying raw messages, so a small context window keeps long-run coherence without restuffing the same history into the prompt on every turn. It scores 94.87% on LongMemEval, the highest recorded result on that benchmark.

## Managing context for long-horizon tasks


Your hardest context problems appear on long-horizon tasks, where the token count needed to finish exceeds the window several times over. Large migrations or multi-hour research runs cannot fit in a single window, so you need techniques that preserve coherence across resets.


*A monitoring loop lets a long-running agent track progress and refresh its working context as a task unfolds.*


Three approaches carry most of the load:


-


**Compaction and summarization:** distill a long conversation into a compact summary and reinitialize a fresh window


-


**Sub-agent isolation:** run focused work in clean windows and return only distilled results


-


**Persistent state:** write intermediate results to a durable store and read them back after resets


### Compaction and summarization


You take a conversation nearing the window limit, summarize it, and reinitialize a fresh window with that summary. Done well, this preserves architectural decisions, open bugs, and key implementation details while discarding redundant tool output. The agent continues with minimal loss of coherence.


The art lies in what you keep versus discard. Overly aggressive compaction drops subtle context whose importance only surfaces later. A practical approach is to maximize recall first, capturing everything potentially relevant, then tune for precision by removing clearly superfluous content like consumed tool results.


### Sub-agents and context isolation


You run focused work in clean windows and return only distilled summaries to a coordinating agent. A lead agent holds the high-level plan while each sub-agent explores deeply, sometimes spending tens of thousands of tokens, and hands back one or two thousand.[Anthropic reported](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system) that multi-agent setups with isolated contexts outperformed single-agent systems on complex research.


The tradeoff is real. Multi-agent architectures can use many times more tokens than a single chat, and they demand careful planning to divide work and coordinate results. Reach for isolation when parallel exploration genuinely pays off, not as a default for every task.


### Persisting state across turns


You keep an agent coherent across summarization steps and session boundaries by writing to a durable store. Structured note-taking, where the agent writes results and reads them back after a reset, lets it track objectives across thousands of steps. This is how agents sustain multi-hour tasks that no single window could hold.


Your runtime state object is the workhorse here. A well-designed schema lets you write intermediate results to specific fields, expose only the message list to the model each turn, and keep everything else retrievable but out of the way. State becomes both your scratchpad and your isolation boundary.


## Context engineering in practice: building an agent


You can see these ideas converge in a concrete build. Consider a multi-agent research assistant where a planning agent breaks a user query into search subtasks. This single component exercises nearly every context concern, from instructions to structured output to retrieval, which makes it a good worked example.


*A planning agent decomposes a query and routes subtasks to specialized agents, each with its own scoped context.*


The planner’s instructions do far more than state a goal. They define the exact fields each subtask must contain, give an ID convention, and constrain priority to a 1-to-5 scale. They also provide a JSON object example so outputs stay consistent. Omitting the scale detail alone would let the model invent its own, breaking the handoff to the next step.


The output schema ties the workflow together. Because the planner emits a parseable schema, downstream search agents consume its results without guesswork. Injecting the current date and time into context lets the planner infer accurate date ranges, so searches target the right window instead of guessing at “last week.”


The build also shows where compression earns its keep. Caching subqueries for repeated user queries lets the system skip regenerating a plan it already has, cutting both cost and response time. That is context engineering as an efficiency lever, not only a correctness one. It chooses the right context for the goal rather than reflexively calling the LLM again.


## Evaluating and debugging context in agent runs


You cannot improve context you cannot see. Because agents run non-deterministically across many steps, the only reliable way to know whether your context engineering helps or hurts is to trace what actually reached the model and measure the result. Evaluation is the feedback loop that turns guesswork into iteration.


### Tracing what context reaches the model


Your first requirement is visibility into every step. Tracing captures each model call, tool invocation, and workflow step as a span, recording the inputs, outputs, token counts, and timing.


Tools like **LangSmith** log each model call alongside the context that produced it, giving you a searchable record of what the model actually saw. With that trace you can see the exact context assembled at each turn, which is where most context bugs hide.


*An agent trace groups every model call and tool invocation under one run, exposing the context and token usage at each step.*


Token accounting matters as much as the sequence. When a run balloons in cost or slows down, the trace shows which tool output or retrieved document flooded the window. That lets you target compression exactly where it pays off instead of trimming blindly across the whole pipeline.


### Evals for context quality


Evals tell you whether a context change improved behavior or quietly regressed it. Running your agent against a fixed dataset with scorers gives you a pass-fail signal on every change, so you catch a summarization tweak that drops recall before users do.


**LangSmith** provides hosted eval runners that score agent trajectories against rubrics you define, making it straightforward to track regressions across deploys. Without evals, you are tuning context on vibes.


You should design evals around the failures context causes. Score for hallucinations to catch context poisoning, for faithfulness to retrieved sources, and for whether the agent used the right tool. LangSmith’s annotation queues let reviewers grade full multi-turn trajectories, not just single answers, which surfaces the degradation that only appears over long runs.


### Guardrails for prompt injection and output sanitization


Your context is an attack surface. Untrusted content pulled into the window through retrieval or tool output can carry prompt injection that hijacks the agent’s behavior. You should treat every external input as suspect and sanitize both what enters the context and what the agent emits.


Mastra supports input and output processors that let you filter and validate content as it flows through an agent, which gives you a place to enforce these guardrails. Pairing that with tracing means you can confirm a malicious payload was caught rather than silently passed to the model.


## Tools and frameworks for context engineering


You have a growing set of frameworks that treat context as a first-class concern. LangGraph exposes low-level control over state, letting you define exactly what each node reads and writes. LangGraph pairs with LangSmith for tracing and evaluation, so you can inspect every context snapshot alongside the score it produced.


This combination suits teams that want fine-grained orchestration and work primarily in Python.[Mastra](https://mastra.ai/ai-agent-framework) covers the same territory for TypeScript teams, bundling memory, workflows, retrieval, and observability so you do not stitch separate tools together. Beyond full frameworks, the **Model Context Protocol** ( **MCP** ) standardizes how agents connect to external data sources, so you can expose context providers once and reuse them across clients.


When you evaluate your options, prioritize a few things:


-


**Tracing and evals:** you cannot engineer context you cannot observe


-


**Memory primitives:** both short-term and long-term recall should be built in


-


**Deployment flexibility:** your framework should deploy wherever your stack runs


The right choice depends on your stack and how much control you want. Low-level frameworks give you precision at the cost of setup. Higher-level ones trade some control for speed.


## Wrapping up


Context engineering comes down to a single discipline: decide, on every turn, the smallest set of high-signal tokens that gets your agent to the right outcome. Start by tracing what reaches the model, apply, write, select, compress, and isolate where the trace shows waste, and measure each change with evals.


For depth on these patterns,[Principles of Building AI Agents](https://mastra.ai/books/principles-of-building-ai-agents) treats context and observability as core production concerns.
